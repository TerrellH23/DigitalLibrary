    <p>This article was written and published in 2007 by Jeffrey Zeldman. This article is about understanding web design. This article tells the truth between actual designers who know about web design and people hired to oversee the design without knowing anything about design. The news media too often gets the wrong idea of web design, it only follows the money flow. The author informs the reader that the media has the wrong idea about web design because editors are pressured publishers worried about vanishing advertisers. Design critics get it wrong too, because people who are good at printing design are usually not all that experienced on the web. The author continues his article by including the elements that make up web design such as typography, architecture, and web design. The author gives his own take on what web design is, he says that web design is “not a book, it is not poster design, it is not illustration, and the highest achievements of those disciplines are not what web design aims for”. Web design is the creation of digital environments that facilitate and encourage human activity, reflect or adapt to individual voices and content. </p></div>
