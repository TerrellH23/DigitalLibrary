    <p>This article is about motion design and how it works and it is a very tough design profession. There are a lot of components when working with motion and it's hard to find that design creative as it gets lost. The author goes to explain what animation is and how the word animation is understood. “Animation is the study of movement using a sequence of images that one another in small variations”. Various techniques include traditional, stop motion, computer, experimentation. Different types of motion design can give off different types of tones to the viewers, such as stop motion and 3d motion. If done right, motion design can give a character a goofy personality by giving the character a goofy walk or facial design. </p>

    <p>This article is about motion design and why motion design is important. Motion is a short form for graphic design. Motion design is made up of three elements such as motion, graphics, design. It is a combination of graphics that are moving space and time. The author explains why motion design is important to designers, companies, and also viewers. The author informs us by giving statistics such as research by MIT that says a person can process visual information in as little as 13 milliseconds which proves that the human brain can process information presented through visuals more easily. Techniques marketers use are traditional ads, promo videos, explainer videos, social media videos. The author names multiple ways a motion design can enhance a user's experience. Create emotionally captivating content, help understand complex procedures, reflect brands personality. </p>

    <p>TThis article was written by Micah Bowers who is a designer. The article is one of the most extensive articles about motion design and it also ventures into how motion affects UX designers and their work. At the beginning of the article, the author grabs the reader's attention by stating that Motion has a profound impact on user experience of digital products, but if interface elements don’t exhibit basic motion design principles, usability is undermined. The first big headline is the Origins of Motion Design. The intertwin of Ux and motion design is relatively new to the world, but motion design roots are in disney. The 12 basic principles of animation were made up by disney famous animators Frank Tomas and Ollie Johnson. Those principles remain to this day as highly influential in motion graphics. Motion design differs from UX design because motion design isn’t ornamentation, it is behavior.</p>

    <p>When it comes to motion design and ux design, they differ but they also compliment each other in multiple different ways. Motion is often an appropriate form of subtle feedback for microinteraction. The main point of this article is to explore the useful, unobstructive feedback animation. UI motion is intended to attract users' attention and also for our peripheral vision. The author starts off by talking about the purpose of UI Design. Animations are less critical for user experience when they are simply time filling visual stimulations during moments of transitions. There are different types of motion designs in terms of UX design such as  motion feedback,motion to communicate state change, motion for spatial metaphors and navigation, motion as signifier. The author wraps his article up by  stating that when animations are subtle, unobstructive, and brief they can improve user experience.
