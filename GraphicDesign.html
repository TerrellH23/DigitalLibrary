    <p>This article was interesting. For some it could be a starter into graphic design. And for others it could be a refresher from what they already know. This gets right to the point on what Graphic Design is and how it is used in today's world. Graphic design can be defined by multiple different things such as visual hierarchy, typography, page layout, and pictures. The article goes on to explain what it means to design for the user. The author goes on to describe what a UX designer is and how they design differently than a normal graphic designer does. UX designers design based on a human centered approach and have to justify their actions and decisions. A UX designer has designed a skill they need to call empathy and it is a must to have to be a UX designer. </p>

  <p>When it comes to Graphic Design, there are multiple tools and programs available, such as InDesign. InDesign is a program for graphic designers that allows for the use of multiple pages to create brochures, magazines, books, articles and more.Indesign is a program created by adobe and like adobe’s other products,InDesign is a dense on structured program with multiple different ways of completing a task. This article helps designers navigate the very dense program by helping them understand anchors and frames. It gives examples and teaches how to use one or more frames. The author describes how to use the tools and then gives examples or pictures on how it is properly used. The author states that InDesign “is intended for static unchanging content”.</p></div>

  <p>Typography is very important to everyone even if they do not know it. For designers, it means more than just choosing different fonts. Every designer uses typography one way or another.

She then goes on to explain why typography is and can be important. The author then covers the different types of topography and different types of elements in typography. Typography is overlooked in many ways but it is an important foundation for many things we might not think about..</p></div>

  <p>Graphic Design is a rapidly growing industry in today’s age. The existing trend of infographics is a living proof of how graphic designing has come. Graphic Designing stands way taller than other means of promoting a business. In today’s age, it is easier to grab the viewer's attention using visual interpretation rather than any other means. The author explains different roles of a graphic designer such as identify, impact, brand message, market your product, and reliability.
