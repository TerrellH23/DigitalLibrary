    <p>Aja Romano wrote an article about how South Korean pop culture has grown in prominence to become a major global culture. K-pop has quickly become an American favorite for many Americans, not just music but also finding its way into Netflix as Korean dramas. K-pop has become increasingly visible to global audiences in the past five to 10 years. As a whole, these songs and performers show us that K-pop stars cna excel at everything from singing to comedy to rap to dance to social commentary. Bts is one the most if not the most popular K-pop groups there is. It certainly seems that the all boy group has gone as far as a South korean group can go in terms of making inroads into American culture.
