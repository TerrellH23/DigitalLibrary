    <p>When we think of Elon Musk, we think of multiple different things such as money, his companies, Tesla,and his newest investment. Elon Musk recently purchased twitter for $44 billion dollars, this has stunned people across the world. Especially the people who work for him now at twitter. Many on the frontline of the fight to democratic spaces online have questioned whether Musk’s ownership of twitter would undermine rather than bolster democracy. They have that his words about freedom of speech rang hollow and did not feel very convincing to them. Some twitter employees believe this record bodes especially poorly for the company’s anti harassment efforts.

    <p>The safety of pregnant women should be the top priority in a company during these terrible times. In the state of Georgia, a pregnant nurse was forced to attend to covid-19 patients. She felt she could still work, but she needed to have the right accommodations to keep working under these circumstances and her employer denied her. After denying her, she asked if she could be transferred and her employer denied her that. She was left with a terrible decision to quit. There is no law that protects pregnant women during this epidemic. According to the National Women’s law center, more than 1 in 5 pregnant workers are employed in low-wage jobs. Pregnant women also encounter prejudice and rigidity that leads to immediate and long term economic harm.

    <p>Now more than ever, do we need mass production. The world is becoming more and more technology based and it is hard for production companies to keep up. Chip shortages will continue to affect 5D pharmaceuticals, and batteries though most of 2022. There will be more shortages when it comes to smartphones and gaming consoles. Consumers will see rising prices and general lack of widespread availability. Apple has already cut iPhone production by 10%.
